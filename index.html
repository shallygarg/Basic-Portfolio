            <p>
                My name is Shally and I am from India. I am the eldest among my siblings and the notorious of all of them. 
                In my childhood, I visited lots of places with my family in the northern part of India.
                 We all loved our summer holidays and when I was around 7 years of age, we went on a trip to Mussoorie.
                  This was the most adventurous trip of my life till now. It nearly cost me my life when I fell from 
                the edge of a hill. the edge opened into deep valley, my mother saw me falling and she came running not to find me anywhere. 
                She started crying when she suddenly heard my voice.. she looked down and saw me stuck on a tree just below the edge. 
                It was a scary experience for both of us. My life later was no less than an adventure in itself, Coming from a 
                business background its not very common in my family for girls to work and I really hated that fact, I 
                believe that men and women should get equal opportunity. I encouraged my younger sister and brother to 
                come out of their comfort zone and strive towards their dreams. I feel very happy when I see them in their present 
                jobs and feel proud to be a factor in their success.
                    
                Coming to my studies, I did my masters in computer applications and learn French for 3 years While I was studying,
                 I got an opportunity to teach French over the weekends. My first job was with School of International 
                 languages in Chandigarh. I also taught French for a short duration at Alliance francaise. I loved 
                 teaching a lot. Language classes are a lot of fun and it gave me a lot of satisfaction when I see my 
                 students speaking a foreign language. Lot of people punjabi go to Canada. Part of my job was also 
                 to train students for Visa interviews in French.
                    
                After I completed my masters, I got an offer from Wipro. My role with Wipro was a combination of my 
                computer and French knowledge. Citrix was Wipro's client at that time and I tested Citrix 
                products on French Operating system and did lingual verification of product documentation. On my 
                b'day in 2008, I got an offer from Citrix. Since then I am working with Globalization team. I am 
                a Sr. Software test engineer. Recently completed Lean Six Sigma black belt certification. Along 
                with leading testing efforts, I am working on few operational excellence initiatives for my team.
                That's pretty much about my journey till now and overcoming my fear of public speaking is the 
                newest challenge in my life and the one that brings me to Toastmasters. "
